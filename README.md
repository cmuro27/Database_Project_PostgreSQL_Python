# Database_Project_PostgreSQL_Python
In this project, we clean, load, and normalize, in PostgreSQL and using Python, a large dataset about educational centers in the Mexican State of Zacatecas.  
The steps followed:  
- Importing as csv  
- Cleaning the data; the column headers, extra spaces, capital letters, ...  
- Exporting the data into a PostgreSql database  
- In PostgreSql, we normalize the data and create a entity relationship diagram.
- We construct two functions where we connect again to the database and query for the name of the schools and the number of students
